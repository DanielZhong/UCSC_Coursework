Lab 3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

-----------
DESCRIPTION

This lab will introduced MIPS ISA using MARS. Users need to write a program with several nested loops to print variable-sized ASCII diamonds and a sequence of embedded numbers.

-----------
FILES

Lab3.asm

This file includes MIPS ISA codes and will print the pattern in the docunment using numbers and stars with a tab between each of them.
-----------
INSTRUCTIONS

This program will print out a pattern with numbers and stars (asterisks). 
1. It will first prompt for the height of the pattern. If the user enters an invalid input such as a negative number or zero, an error message will be printed and the user will be prompted again.
2. Each symbol(either a number or space) should be separated by a tab (not space) 
3. Then your program should print the following pattern using numbers and stars with a tab between each of them.
