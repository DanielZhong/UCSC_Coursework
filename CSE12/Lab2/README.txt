FILES

Lab2.lgi

This file includes sequential logic circuit(a simple data path with a register file, ALU, and user inputs.)
-----------
INSTRUCTIONS

In this lab, user design a sequential logic circuit based on the overall design diagram(data paths) and specification in the google docs. In addition, student also needs to design left arithmetic shift alu instead of using MML libary one.
