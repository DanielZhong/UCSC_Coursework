Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

This lab introduces user to a schematic entry logic simulation program, Multimedia Logic (MMLogic or MML). In this lab user will practice creating truth tables and implementing logic based on those truth tables.

This file includes 3 simple circuit(from part a, part b, and part c) of the lab.

INSTRUCTIONS

Part A: Connect the wires from the user input switches to the 7 segment display component.
Part B: Design a circuit from the truth table
Part C: Implement the truth table using Sum of Products (SOP) or Product of Sums (POS). Then implement the SOP or POS using only NAND gates and build the same SOP or POS using only NOR gates.
